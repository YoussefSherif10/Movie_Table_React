#Table Of Movies

This project consists of a fictitious database that is essentially a list of objects, each of which contains information about a movie. 

In this project, I used React to display the data as a table and provide some basic features, such the ability to remove movies, update text in response to changes, and like or dislike movies.
Pagination was added by breaking the movies into pages with a maximum of four movies per page. utilised the bootstrap pagination element. implemented the pagination algorithm in the utils using lodash library 

For the table and the head CSS, I utilised bootstrap.
