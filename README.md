#Table Of Movies

This project consists of a fictitious database that is essentially a list of objects, each of which contains information about a movie. 

In order to present the data as a table and enable some fundamental capabilities, such as the ability to remove movies, update text in reaction to changes, and like or dislike movies, I utilised React. 

For the table and the head CSS, I utilised bootstrap.
